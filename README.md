**Emotion Classification System**

# Overview:
  - The following project uses **Convolutional Neural Networks** to detect emotions in images provided by the user.
  - The initial system is trained on around 400 *Google Images* depicting 3 emotions: happy, sad, and confused.
  - The model can be expanded for more classes with improvements in neural layers.

# Dependencies:
  - *OpenCV*: for image processing and performing computer vision tasks.
  - *imghdr*: a library for image type determination.
  - *matplotlib*: for visualization and plotting.
  - *tensorflow*: for model implementation and layer building.
  - *numpy*
  - *OS*: provides functions for interacting with the operating system.

# Usage:
  This project can be scaled up for determining various emotions from human images. The TensorFlow dataset API is widely used through Keras to implement various pipeline configurations for input images.

# Data:
  - Due to the large size of input images, a Google Drive link to the images is provided in the respective folder of images and model.
  - Please refer to the link and download the images to your local machine.
